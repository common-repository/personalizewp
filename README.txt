Add personalization features to your content. Use our preset conditional rules or add your own, match user behavior and show/hide blocks.

== Description ==

PersonalizeWP is the easiest way to display personalized content on your WordPress website using the Block Editor.

Providing pre-built rules out of the box, it allows you to show or hide any block, using a set of comprehensive options, including user roles, location, device type, date or time of day, referrer and more.

Designed to work with any hosting platform, the plugin provides a real-time experience even when your site is fully cached.

If you want to tailor the experience of your visitors so that their experience matches what they want and need to view, then PersonalizeWP is the right plugin for you.

=== Show/Hide content quickly and easily ===

If you know how to use the Block Editor, then you'll find it simple to add complex rules to the blocks you create.

In the sidebar for every block, you'll see a Personalize section - here you can choose one or more rules to apply to a block, and then decide whether to show or hide the content if the rules apply to that visitor.

For instance:

- Create a block on a page to provide details of an offer code
- Choose the 'Visitors from the UK' rule
- Choose to Show the block if the rule matches

That's it!

The content block will then only show if the visitor is from the UK, and if they are from any other country, it won't be shown (even in the source code).


=== Pre-built rules out of the box ===

To get you up and running quickly, we've created a set of rules for you to use without any setup or configuration. This no-code solution provides you with the easiest way to get started with personalising your site.

You can start using the following rules to show or hide blocks immediately:

- If a user is viewing the site using a desktop or a mobile device
- If the user is accessing the site for the first time, or a returning user
- If the user is logged in, or logged out
- If the user is based in the UK or the USA
- If a user has spent 10 seconds, 30 seconds, or 1 minute viewing a page
- If the time is the morning, afternoon or evening


=== Custom Rule Options ===

The preset rules are just to get you going. The real power of PersonalizeWP is in the ability to create your own custom rules, which provide complete flexibility to choose your own scenarios of when you show or hide content.

In addition to creating rules based on:

- User Device
- New vs Returning User
- User is logged in/out
- User Location
- Time on Current Page
- Visit Period

You can create new rules that meet your needs based on:

- Last Visit
- Date
- Day of Week
- Visit Time
- User Role
- Referrer - where the user has come from
- Cookie - if a cookie exists in their browser
- Query String - text in the URL
- UTM Tags, such as utm_campaign
- WooCommerce - If the cart has contents or not
- WooCommerce - If the user has completed a purchase
- WooCommerce - Total spend by a customer
- WooCommerce - Total products purchased by a customer

With all of these rule types comes the ability to choose from a set of comparators such as Is Equal To, Does Not Equal, Before and After.


=== Upgrade to Pro for full Personalization ===

For those that want or need an even more engaging experience for users, and that is based upon their lifecycle through your website, then we also have a [Pro version of PersonalizeWP](https://personalizewp.com/pricing/).

The Pro version has been developed specifically for website owners, businesses and agencies that want to understand what users are doing on their site, build a profile of their behaviour, score their actions, and segment them into groups.


= Visitor Profiles =

PersonalizeWP allows you to track visitors across your site, without the use of cookies, so you can build a profile of each user.

Starting with an anonymous profile when they first arrive, we extend what we know about the user as they browse the site, and our integrations with Gravity Forms and WooCommerce allow us to start adding real-world data.


= Segments =

Segmenting your audience into purposeful groups is key to delivering bespoke, personalized experiences.

By using our intuitive segmentation feature, you can easily define groups using a range of different variables such as pages visited, products purchased, location, or forms completed.

PersonalizeWP adds visitor profiles to segments automatically as they meet the criteria - and will keep them up-to-date as their behaviour on your site changes.


= Lead-Scoring =

Assigning a score to an action that a user takes can help you to better understand how engaged they are with your site and content, helping you to gauge lead quality.

You can set specific thresholds to identify promising opportunities and also assign negative points to keep scores in check.

And you assign them to a segment using a score, meaning that you can keep all your highly interested leads in a single bucket.


= Using Pro Features in the Block Editor =

The Pro version of the plugin also brings all of these additional features into the Block Editor.

This means that not only can you choose to Show/Hide content based on personalisation rules, but you can also filter that by Segment and Lead Score, and because these are driven by Visitor Profiles, your options are endless.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What is PersonalizeWP? =

PersonalizeWP is a WordPress plugin designed to add personalization features to WordPress. It follows similar principles to Enterprise platforms such as Episerver, Optimizely and Sitecore and works in conjunction with the Block editor to provide a simple and clear pathway to this functionality for content authors and admins.

= What can I use it for? =

You can use PersonalizeWP to personalize content to your users, based on actions that they have taken, or criteria such as which countries they are accessing your site from. We have included basic rules into the plugin to provide a starting point and you can add your own rules, based on a set of conditions, and then apply those to any blocks you wish.

= How do I use PersonalizeWP? =

Once you have the plugin installed and activated, a PersonalizeWP option will appear in the Block Settings sidebar in the editor when you are editing a block. Within this, you will be given the choice to choose a rule and determine an action if that rule is met. For instance, you may wish to add a content block with a message that is only shown to the user if they come from a particular country, or if they have purchased a product from your store. Feel free to play around and let us know if you think.

= Are there any limitations? =

The actions that you can take when a rule is met, are currently limited to Show or Hide a block. We will be adding new actions in a future release. The plugin does not work with the Classic Block - which is due to be deprecated. You can use the Convert to Blocks feature to transform the Classic Block into independent blocks, which can then take advantage of PersonalizeWP.

= Will the plugin always be free to use? =

We will always have a free version of the plugin, but in the future, it is likely that we will add a Pro version which will offer additional features.
